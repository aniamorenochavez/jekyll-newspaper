Newspaper type blog built in bootstrap for Jekyll users. I just started working on this so give me some time to add in amazing features. You can install this theme as a gem by using `gem install jekyll-newspaper` for now it is a repo to hold this template. Eventually I will update the one in the gem install process.

## Installation

There are a few different ways to install this theme.

### Clone It Locally:

Clone it locally using `git clone https://github.com/yosileyid/jekyll-newspaper.git` then work on it on your own. You will need to edit **_config.yml** and change `baseurl` and `url` 

```yaml
baseurl : "/"     # Or whatever your subdirectory is EX: /blog
url     : ""      # Use this for local development, change the values for your live site 
```
then in your terminal cd into `jekyll-newspaper` and do `bundle exec jekyll serve` it should look like

It starts really fast and throws no errors or warnings. I want to keep it that way as it develops. If you run into any Issues please fill out a bug report either on [Github Issues](#issues--bug-reporting) or in Discord in the bug-reporting forums.
